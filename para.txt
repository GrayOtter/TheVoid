I choose to write about ekelokorpi/panda-engine under JavaScript Game Engines. From what I can see the way they deal with pull request is only those with write access to the repository could merge pull request. They properly make things added or found as “features” or “Bugs” with good description of the problems that are new or ongoing. They have a code of conduct for how people should act and contribute. They also have a Contributing guide. They properly number updates/releases and keep the whole project well organized.
